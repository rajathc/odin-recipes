        <h3>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</h3>

            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
                
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
                
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
                
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
                
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
                
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.


            </li>
            <li>
                While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
